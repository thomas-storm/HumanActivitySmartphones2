# Description of the data
The zip-file contains the following files
- readme.txt with relevant information
- activity_labels.txt with 6 activity labels
- features.txt with a list of "features" to be used as variable names
- features_info.txt with relevant information on the features
- test/subject_test.txt with the subject IDs for the test data 2947 entries
- test/X_test.txt with the test data 2947 x 561 entries
- test/y_test.txt codes the activities in test data 2947 entries
- train/subject_train.txt with the subject IDs for the train data 7352 entries
- train/X_train.txt with the train data 7352 x 561 entries
- train/y_train.txt codes the activities in train data 7352 entries   
# Variables
The variable experiment was created to allow subsetting for test and train
The variable subject and activity were created from the files included on the zip file
The variables 4 - 69 were selected as mean and standard deviations, and the description updated to better human readable form.
Results are either TIME or FREQuency domain, and described as MEAN or STDEV. Further details can be found in the file features_info.txt
